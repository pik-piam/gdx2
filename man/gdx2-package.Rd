\title{gdx2: Interface package for GDX files in R}
\description{
A wrapper package for the gamstransfer package extending its functionality and allowing to read GDX files directly in R. It is emulating the basic features of the readGDX function in the gdx package but now based on gamstransfer instead of gdxrrw which served as a basis for gdx.
